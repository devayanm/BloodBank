## ✨ Abstract

India continues to grapple with critical shortages in blood and organ donations, largely due to outdated, fragmented, or region-limited systems. Our Cloud-Based Blood and Organ Donation System unifies these workflows into a modern platform, centralizing crucial donor/hospital/camp data, real-time updates, and educational resources. The result: a more efficient, transparent, and motivating donation ecosystem.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dual-Tabbed UI:** Effortlessly switch between Blood & Organ donation interfaces.
- **Location-aware Search:** Find local hospitals/camps on an interactive map (powered by [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)).
- **Real-time Notifications:** Stay updated on events, reminders, and registration status (with react-toastify).
- **Gamified Leaderboard:** Top donors recognized for their lifesaving frequency and impact.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Tools for hospitals/NGOs: verify donors, manage stocks/waitlists, promote events, view analytics.
- **Educational Hub:** Reliable info and FAQs about donation eligibility, legal, and ethical guidelines.
- **Modern Responsive UI:** Designed after leading food/gig apps for a seamless experience on any device.
